        <h3>At the begining</h3>
        <p>
          Formerly a school teacher, I joined a web development bootcamp
          @BeCode. I encountered barriers in my practice and wanted to develop
          an app to optimize my work. It was while discussing the feasibility of
          the project with a developer that... "oh! God! I will never look back!
          I was definitively hooked, made for this... and now determined to
          dedicate the rest of my career to it!
        </p>

        <h3>First steps</h3>
        <p>
          During my training, I quickly became passionate about backend
          development. I only had the opportunity to create one project in
          Python during which I became familiar with OOP. Second crush. Code that is more solid yet modifiable,
          better structured, more efficient, and faster to debug. The desire to
          delve into this kind of language has now become a certainty.

        <h3>And tomorrow?</h3>
        <p>
          Continue learning! That's the goal I set for myself from my first day
          at BeCode: to find an employer who, despite my technical level, will
          have confidence in my learning abilities, ready to entrust me with
          responsibilities to see me progress rapidly within a dynamic and
          highly skilled team. I am motivated and resourceful. <strong>It's all a matter
            of opportunities!</strong>

                <p>Software development is at the core of what drives and stimulates me. It allows me, unlike web development, to invest my skills in durable, inherently useful products. It allows me to support projects with major societal impact by improving or facilitating the daily lives of both businesses and citizens. It fulfills me intellectually due to the necessity to analyze and solve real-world problems in an environment that is constantly changing.</p>
